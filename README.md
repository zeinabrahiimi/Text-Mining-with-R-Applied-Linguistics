## R Text Mining and Word Cloud Visualization Project for IELTS Text Data
This R project is specifically designed for text mining and creating a word cloud from a collection of IELTS text documents to visualize word frequency patterns within the IELTS text data.
Additionally, I visualized frequently co-occurring bigrams (groups of two words) and trigrams (groups of three words) using wordnetworks. 
You can find the IELTS dataset and the images displaying the word cloud and word network in the repository.
